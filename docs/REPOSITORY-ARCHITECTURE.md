# Repository Architecture

## Overview

This document explains the repository architecture strategy for the home lab infrastructure and development projects. As of 2025-10-17, we transitioned from a monolithic `dev-lab` repository to a focused, purpose-specific repository structure.

---

## The Problem: Monolithic Repository

**What happened:**
- `dev-lab` repository grew to include everything: blockchain research, bug bounty tools, templates, network infrastructure, microservices
- Total scope became too large for AI assistants to maintain context
- AI responses showed confusion about what belonged where
- Documentation became scattered across unrelated domains
- Single repository made it hard to share specific components

**Symptoms:**
- "dev-lab is getting too big" - Context overload
- AI assistants mixing concerns (blockchain + infrastructure + bug bounty)
- Difficulty finding relevant files
- Git history mixing unrelated changes

---

## The Solution: Focused Repositories

**Strategy:** Split monolithic repository into focused, single-purpose repositories.

**Core Principle:** Each repository should have a clear, singular purpose that can be described in one sentence.

---

- Descriptive, not abbreviated: `ydun-scraper` not `ys`
- Singular for services: `mundus-context-engine`
- Plural for collections: `cardano-nodes`

### Branch Names
- `main` - Primary branch (not `master`)
- `feature/description` - Feature branches
- `fix/description` - Bug fix branches
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates

### File Naming
- Uppercase for important docs: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- Lowercase for code: `http_server.py`, `config.yml`
- Hyphens for multi-word: `docker-compose.yml`
- Descriptive names: `NEXT-SESSION-START-HERE.md`

---

## Future Considerations

### Monorepo vs Polyrepo

**Current choice:** Polyrepo (multiple focused repositories)

**Rationale:**
- Better for AI context management
- Clearer boundaries
- Independent deployment
- Easier to understand scope

**Future:** If cross-repo changes become frequent, consider monorepo tools (Nx, Turborepo)

### Repository Templates

**Planned:** GitHub repository template for new projects

**Would include:**
- Pre-configured AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, JIMMYS-WORKFLOW.md
- Standard .gitignore patterns
- README.md template
- GitHub Actions workflows (optional)

### Automation

**Planned automation:**
- Template sync script (dev-lab/templates â†’ other repos)
- Repository health checks (missing files, outdated templates)
- Cross-repo documentation links validation

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

1. **Early split:** Splitting before repositories got too large
2. **Clear purpose:** Each repo has single, clear purpose
3. **Template standards:** Consistent structure across repos
4. **Documentation first:** Document architecture before migrating

### What to Avoid

1. **Too granular:** Don't create repo for every tiny service
2. **Unclear boundaries:** Define what goes where upfront
3. **Duplicate docs:** Keep single source of truth
4. **Inconsistent standards:** Maintain template compliance

### Best Practices

1. **Ask the question:** "Can I describe this repo's purpose in one sentence?"
2. **Test the boundary:** Use decision matrix to validate placement
3. **Document decisions:** Record why things are where they are
4. **Regular review:** Reassess architecture as projects grow

---

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What if code needs to be shared between repos?**
A: Extract to library, publish as package, or duplicate if small. Document the decision.

**Q: How do we keep templates in sync?**
A: Manual sync when needed. Templates evolve slowly, so this is acceptable.

**Q: What about secrets and credentials?**
A: Always gitignored. Document *where* they're stored, not the secrets themselves.

**Q: Should infrastructure code live with application code?**
A: No. Infrastructure deployment lives in dev-network. Application code lives in app repo.

**Q: When should we create a new repository?**
A: When a component has a clear, singular purpose and benefits from independent lifecycle.

---

## Conclusion

The focused repository architecture provides:
- Clear boundaries and ownership
- Better AI assistant performance
- Easier collaboration and sharing
- Independent deployment cycles
- Clearer documentation

This strategy supports the long-term maintainability and growth of the home lab infrastructure.
