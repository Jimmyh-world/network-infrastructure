ssh jamesb@192.168.68.53   # Different usernames to remember
```

**After:**
```bash
ssh beast     # Works from anywhere, globally
ssh guardian  # Simple, consistent
```

## 🛠️ Common Operations

### SSH to Machines
```bash
# From anywhere (Chromebook, phone, coffee shop)
ssh beast
ssh guardian

# Legacy local network access (backup)
ssh jimmyb@192.168.68.100  # Beast local IP
ssh jamesb@192.168.68.53   # Guardian WiFi IP
```

### Access Internal Services Remotely
```bash
# SSH tunnel to Grafana
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 beast
# Then open: http://localhost:3000

# SSH tunnel to Prometheus
ssh -L 9090:localhost:9090 beast
# Then open: http://localhost:9090

# SSH tunnel to Vault
ssh -L 8200:localhost:8200 beast
# Then open: http://localhost:8200
```

### Check Tailscale Status
```bash
# Show all devices
tailscale status

# Show subnet routes
tailscale status --json | grep -i route

# Show your Tailscale IP
tailscale ip -4
```

### Manage Tailscale
```bash
# Restart Tailscale
sudo systemctl restart tailscaled

# Check Tailscale logs
sudo journalctl -u tailscaled -f

# Disconnect
sudo tailscale down

# Reconnect
sudo tailscale up
```

## 🌍 Remote Access Use Cases

### 1. Development from Anywhere
```bash
# Coffee shop → SSH to Beast → deploy code
ssh beast
cd ~/dev-network/beast/docker
docker compose restart grafana
```

### 2. Infrastructure Monitoring
```bash
# Phone → SSH to Beast → check Docker
ssh beast "docker compose ps"
ssh beast "docker stats --no-stream"
```

### 3. Emergency Access
```bash
# Traveling → SSH to Guardian → check Pi-hole
ssh guardian "pihole status"
ssh guardian "pihole -c"
```

### 4. Three-Machine Coordination
```bash
# From Chromebook, coordinate across all machines
ssh beast "git pull origin main"
ssh guardian "sudo apt update"
```

### 5. Access Home Network Remotely
```bash
# Via subnet router, access ANY device at home
ping 192.168.68.1      # Deco router
ssh 192.168.68.100     # Beast local IP
http://192.168.68.10   # Guardian Pi-hole (via tunnel)
```

## 📱 Mobile Setup (Samsung Phone)

**Already Connected:**
- Device: samsung-sm-s938b
- IP: 100.121.158.52
- Status: ✅ Active

**Next Steps for Full Mobile Access:**
1. Install Termius SSH client (or similar)
2. Configure SSH to Beast: `beast` (hostname auto-resolves)
3. Configure SSH to Guardian: `gaurdian`
4. Test: SSH from phone → `ssh beast`
5. Access services via SSH tunnels

## 🔒 Security Benefits

### Authentication
- ✅ Single sign-on via Tailscale account
- ✅ No exposed SSH ports (22) to internet
- ✅ Device-level authorization
- ✅ Audit trail in Tailscale admin console

### Network Security
- ✅ Encrypted mesh (WireGuard protocol)
- ✅ No port forwarding on router
- ✅ No VPN server to maintain
- ✅ Zero-trust architecture

### Access Control
- ✅ Revoke device access instantly (admin console)
- ✅ Per-device authentication
- ✅ Subnet route approval required

---

## 🎯 Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### Replaces/Improves
- ❌ Traditional SSH keys (still work as backup)
- ❌ Manual IP address management
- ❌ VPN server setup (WireGuard, OpenVPN)
- ❌ Dynamic DNS services
- ❌ Port forwarding

### Complements
- ✅ Cloudflare Tunnels (still needed for public web access)
- ✅ Deco XE75 network (local network backbone)
- ✅ Guardian Pi (now accessible remotely)
- ✅ Beast services (now manageable globally)

### Three-Machine Architecture
**Before Tailscale:**
- Chromebook → GitHub ← Beast (sync only)
- No direct Chromebook ↔ Beast communication off local network

**After Tailscale:**
- Chromebook ↔ Beast (direct, globally)
- Chromebook ↔ Guardian (direct, globally)
- Beast ↔ Guardian (direct, globally)
- All via simple hostnames: `ssh beast`, `ssh guardian`

---

## 📈 Performance

### Latency
- Local network: ~1-3ms (via subnet router)
- Tailscale direct: ~2-5ms (on same LAN)
- Remote access: Depends on internet (typically 10-50ms)

### Throughput
- Optimized WireGuard protocol
- Minimal overhead vs direct connection
- Suitable for SSH, file transfers, port forwarding

### Reliability
- ✅ Automatic reconnection
- ✅ NAT traversal (works behind firewalls)
- ✅ Multi-path routing (finds best route)
- ✅ Failover to relay servers if needed

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Can't SSH to Beast/Guardian
```bash
# Check Tailscale is running locally
tailscale status

# Check target machine is online
tailscale status | grep beast

# Try ping first
ping beast

# Check SSH service on target
ssh beast "sudo systemctl status ssh"
```

### Subnet Routing Not Working
```bash
# Verify subnet route approved in admin console
# https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines

# Check Guardian is advertising routes
ssh guardian "tailscale status --self"

# Check local routing table
ip route | grep tailscale
```

### Tailscale Not Starting
```bash
# Restart Tailscale service
sudo systemctl restart tailscaled

# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u tailscaled --no-pager | tail -50

# Re-authenticate if needed
sudo tailscale up
```
