# Session Summary: 2025-10-17

**Date:** Friday, 2025-10-17
**Duration:** ~6 hours (07:00 - 13:30 UTC)
**Primary Goal:** Deploy Beast monitoring infrastructure + ydun-scraper microservice
**Status:** ✅ Complete - All objectives achieved

## Configuration Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| cloudflared on host (not Docker) | Direct localhost access, simpler credential management | Docker container with volume mounts | ✅ Working cleanly, no permission issues |
| Split repositories | dev-lab too big, AI context confusion | Keep monolithic repo | ✅ Better organization, clearer boundaries |
| kitt.agency domain | User had domain available, free Cloudflare tier | Purchase new domain or use different service | ✅ Working perfectly |
| Host-based tunnel vs Docker | Avoid Docker networking complexity for tunnel | cloudflared as 7th Docker service | ✅ Simpler, more reliable |
| ydun-scraper as separate repo | Independent microservice lifecycle | Include in dev-network | ✅ Cleaner separation |
| Port 5000 for scraper external | Avoid conflict with cAdvisor (8080) | Use different port | ✅ No conflicts, clean routing |
| Monitoring network isolation | Secure container communication | Host networking | ✅ Better security |
| 30-day Prometheus retention | Balance storage vs history | 7 days or 90 days | ✅ Good balance (2GB storage) |

---

## Issues Encountered & Resolved

| Issue | Symptoms | Root Cause | Resolution | Prevention |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Docker installation hung** | get-docker.sh appeared stuck for 8+ minutes | Silent mode (`-qq` flag) suppressing output | Waited for completion | Understand installation can be silent |
| **Forgot to push to GitHub** | Beast couldn't pull latest changes | Created docs locally but didn't commit/push | Always push before remote pull | Use git status before remote operations |
| **3 duplicate cloudflared processes** | Multiple processes running simultaneously | Multiple restart attempts without killing old processes | pkill all, start fresh | Document single-process requirement |
| **Unused cloudflared Docker service** | docker-compose.yml had service definition not being used | Initial deployment included Docker service, later moved to host | Remove from docker-compose.yml | Clean up early when architecture changes |
| **Tilde path in docker-compose.yml** | ~/ydun-scraper might not expand correctly | Used tilde for convenience | Replace with absolute path /home/jimmyb/ | Always use absolute paths in Docker |
| **Port 5000 vs 8080 confusion** | Haiku initially configured scraper on wrong port | Misunderstanding of internal vs external ports | Fix config.yml to use correct port | Validate port mappings |
| **.env file missing (assumed)** | Couldn't verify from Chromebook | File is gitignored by design | Check on Beast first before creating | Remember gitignored files aren't synced |
| **Portainer 502 via tunnel** | External access returns 502 error | Self-signed certificate not accepted by cloudflared | Use local access instead (non-critical) | Document known limitation |

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Focused repositories:** Splitting dev-lab immediately improved clarity
2. **Haiku YOLO mode:** Excellent for autonomous workflow execution
3. **Jimmy's Workflow:** RED/GREEN/CHECKPOINT prevented issues
4. **Documentation-first:** Creating workflows before execution saved time
5. **Host-based tunnel:** Simpler than Docker-based approach
6. **Template standards:** Consistent across all repositories

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Always check gitignored files:** Assumed .env was missing when it existed
2. **Verify ports early:** Port confusion caused initial 502 errors
3. **Kill old processes:** Multiple tunnel processes from restart attempts
4. **Push before remote operations:** Forgot to push docs before Beast pulled
5. **Document architecture decisions immediately:** Don't wait until end

### Best Practices Reinforced

1. **YAGNI principle:** Only deployed what's needed NOW, not future services
2. **Fix Now rule:** Never deferred issues, fixed immediately
3. **Validation gates:** Always validate before checkpointing
4. **Rollback procedures:** Document rollback for every phase
5. **Factual documentation:** Objective language, actual dates, no marketing
