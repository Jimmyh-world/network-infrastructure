- What goes in network-infrastructure vs other repos
- Current repository structure
- Planned future repositories
- Benefits of focused repositories
- How to decide what goes where

**Key points to document:**
- dev-lab was getting too big (context overload for AI)
- network-infrastructure: Guardian + Beast + networking only
- ydun-scraper: Independent microservice repo
- Future: blockchain nodes, bug bounty, other projects as separate repos
- Each repo has own AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, JIMMYS-WORKFLOW.md

**Step 1.2: Create repository inventory table**

Document:
- network-infrastructure (this repo)
- dev-lab (original, now reduced scope)
- ydun-scraper (microservice)
- Future planned repositories

### 🟢 GREEN - Validation

**Step 1.3: Verify document exists**
```bash

Content should include:

**Section 1: Service Access Table**

| Service | Local Network | External HTTPS | Authentication |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Grafana | http://192.168.68.100:3000 | https://grafana.kitt.agency | Username: admin, Password: .env file |
| Scraper | http://192.168.68.100:5000 | https://scrape.kitt.agency | None (open API) |
| Portainer | https://192.168.68.100:9443 | N/A (502 error) | Set on first access |
| Prometheus | http://192.168.68.100:9090 | N/A (internal only) | None |
| Beast SSH | ssh jimmyb@192.168.68.100 | N/A | SSH key: beast@dev-lab |

**Section 2: Credential Locations**

Where credentials are stored:
- Grafana admin password: `~/network-infrastructure/beast/docker/.env` (gitignored)
- SSH key: `~/.ssh/` on Chromebook (beast@dev-lab)
- Cloudflare tunnel: `~/.cloudflared/` on Beast (gitignored)
- Cloudflare account: kitt.agency domain (free tier)

**Section 3: Network Architecture**

```
Chromebook (192.168.68.x) ←→ Router (192.168.68.1) ←→ Beast (192.168.68.100)
                                        ↓
                                    Internet
                                        ↓
                                Cloudflare Edge
                                        ↓
                                kitt.agency domain
```

**Section 4: Access Methods by Use Case**

**Development/debugging:**
- Use local network (http://192.168.68.100:PORT)
- Faster, no tunnel dependency
- Full access to all services

**Production/external:**
- Use Cloudflare Tunnel (https://*.kitt.agency)
- Works from anywhere
- HTTPS encrypted
- Only Grafana and Scraper exposed

**Emergency access:**
- SSH to Beast: `ssh jimmyb@192.168.68.100`
- Use Docker CLI directly
- Check logs: `docker compose logs -f`

**Section 5: Troubleshooting Access Issues**

Problem: Can't access Grafana
- Check Beast is running: `ping 192.168.68.100`
- Check Docker: `ssh jimmyb@192.168.68.100 "docker compose ps"`
- Check tunnel: `ssh jimmyb@192.168.68.100 "ps aux | grep cloudflared"`

Problem: External HTTPS not working
- Check tunnel status: `cloudflared tunnel info <tunnel-id>`
- Check DNS: `nslookup grafana.kitt.agency`
- Check logs: `tail -50 /tmp/cloudflared.log` on Beast

**Section 6: Security Considerations**

- All external traffic encrypted via Cloudflare Tunnel
- No port forwarding on router (more secure)
- Credentials stored locally only (gitignored)
- SSH key-based authentication (no passwords)
- Grafana admin password should be changed from default
